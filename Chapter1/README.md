# Serpents Skull - Book 1: Smugglers Shiv (Level's 1-4) 

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder second edition (2E)

  - Please keep in mind this is currently a WIP, some links to statblocks or otherwise may not work yet
  - This conversion guide only covers the items that have changed in 2E. This includes NPCs and creatures, hazards, XP, treasure, and some tactics where they don't convert well from 1E.
  - The plot, backstory, color text, floor plans, maps, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
  - Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/).
  - Unique and missing 2E creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in the statblocks directory of each book so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available.
  - If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then post on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H) or create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.

## General GM information

  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
  - Not every DC is converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. All other DCs are left to GM discretion. See [level based DCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554) for guidance.

## Party Leveling Milestones

- Level 2: Once the party is ready to explore Smuggler's Shiv
- Level 3: Just before reaching Pezock or the Cannibal Ambush
- Level 4: By the end of Part 3
- Level 5: This could happen if the party explores majority of the island, and random encounters are used with frequency
